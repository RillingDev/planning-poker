# Planning Poker

A tool to play [Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker).

## Usage

When the JAR file is executed, a web server will be started and listen at <http://localhost:8080>.

Configuration may be done using [properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.properties-and-configuration.external-properties-location).

### Requirements

- JRE 17

### Authentication

Authentication is possible via [OIDC](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)>).
<https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/login/core.html> gives an overview over the required configuration.
It must be ensured that the resolved username (see `user-name-attribute` in the previous link) is unique across all users.

**Important: Using multiple OIDC providers at the same time is not supported by this application.**

### Extensions

Extensions may be enabled by [starting the application with additional profiles](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.properties-and-configuration.set-active-spring-profiles).

#### Aha!

The [Aha!](https://www.aha.io/ideas/overview) extension can be enabled by starting the application with the profile `extension:aha`.
The following additional properties must be set:

- `planning-poker.extension.aha.account-domain`: The subdomain part that the target Aha! instance is running on. For
  example, if you use `https://example.aha.io`, this would be `example`.
- `planning-poker.extension.aha.client-id`: The Aha! OAuth2 client ID. See <https://www.aha.io/api/oauth2> for details.
- `planning-poker.extension.aha.redirect-uri`: The Aha! OAuth2 redirect URI. Should be the address the application is
  running on.

Note that the Aha! Integration only works when the application is available under HTTPS.

##### Usage

A button "Load from Aha!" will appear next to the room name. It can be used to load the details of an Aha! ID or URL into the room.
If the topic of a room is set to an Aha! idea ID or URL, a button to submit the average score to Aha! will show up after the voting is completed.

## Development

### Requirements

- Node.js 20
- JDK 17
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA

### HTTPS

Create a keystore with a self-signed certificate (https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-https-self-signed-certificate) and adapt the `application-development.properties` parameters.
Then export the certificate and its key, and make them available for Vite (`vite.config.ts`).

### Development Mode

Start the run config `backend:dev` and `frontend:dev` and go to <https://localhost:8443>.
Note that you may want to create a copy of `backend:dev` configured with an OIDC provider.

### Build for Production

Start the IntelliJ run configuration `package`. This will create an executable JAR file in `./target`.
You can then also use the `Dockerfile` to build a container image.

### Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Background

This project was developed for my "Ausbildung (Externenpr√ºfung) Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung" (a form of apprenticeship in Germany).
Thanks to [Pointsharp GmbH](https://www.cryptshare.com) for letting me work on this project during my employment.
